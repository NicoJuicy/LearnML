# Software Engineering


SOLID is an acronym for five software design principles that help make software robust and maintainable. Understanding and applying the five principle is the hallmark for good software engineering. Thus, it is any aspiring software engineer should be acquainted with them.

Cohesion refers to the interconnection between functions in a class. While coupling refers to the interdependence between classes. Source: [1]

The goal is to develop software with high cohesion and low coupling.

High cohesion means we want functions in a class to be performing tasks that are related to each other. 

Low coupling means classes should not depend too much on each other. 

## The Single-responsibility Principle

The single-responsibility principle helps us achieve the goal of high cohesion and low coupling.

A class should only have a single purpose. 

If the functionality of the class needs to be changed there should only be one reason to do so.
